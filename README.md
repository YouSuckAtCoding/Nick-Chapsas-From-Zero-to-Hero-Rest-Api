as Swagger integration, JWT authentication, Cache with Redis, Database health checks, Dependency Injection, Domain Drives Design, SDK and migration from Controllers to Minimal Apis.
It also implements versioning with Asp.Versioning.Mvc nuget package, improved swagger documentation, versioning with Swagger and Api Key authentication.

The code is in C# and uses the ASP.NET framework. It uses packages such as Fluent Validation and uses Docker to access a Postgres database. 
This project is a elegant and efficient way to create APIs in .NET while accounting for desing, readability, performance and just overall great coding practices for API development.
